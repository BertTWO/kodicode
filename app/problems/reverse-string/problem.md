### Reverse a String

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

##### Example 1
```
Input: hello
Output: olleh
```

##### Example 2
```
Input: mark 
Output: kram
```

##### Constraints
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10⁴
- -10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹
- Only one valid answer exists
